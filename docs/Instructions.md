Landing Page Creation Prompt (Rayavriti)

You are a senior frontend engineer and UI designer building a simple, high-impact landing page for a technology and networking company called Rayavriti.

The brand aesthetic is dark, futuristic, high-contrast, and engineering-first. The UI must feel confident, sharp, and future-ready, not playful or decorative.

Assets & Setup

The following assets already exist in the root directory:

Wordmark logo

Iconic mark

Full lockup logo

Use these assets directly from the root (do not inline or recreate logos).

Prefer SVG usage where possible.

Design Constraints (Strict)

Background color: #11110B

Primary accent color: #d9fd3a

No gradients, no pastel colors, no illustrations

Minimal shadows, only where necessary

High contrast at all times

Sharp geometry, clean spacing, no rounded playful elements

Typography

Headings: League Spartan, uppercase, bold

Body text: Space Grotesk

Clear hierarchy with generous spacing

Avoid long paragraphs; concise and confident copy

Page Structure (Simple & Clean)
1. Header

Left: Full lockup logo

Right: Minimal navigation (Home, Services, Contact) or a single CTA

Sticky header with subtle border or separation

2. Hero Section

Large, bold headline (uppercase)

Short supporting subtext (1–2 lines max)

Primary CTA button (electric green)

Optional subtle glow effect on CTA

Use empty space intentionally

3. About / Value Section

2–3 short statements explaining:

Technology

Security

Growth

Can be displayed as cards or inline blocks

Use iconic mark as a subtle visual accent (not dominant)

4. Services / Capabilities

3–4 concise items (no long descriptions)

Focus on:

Networking

IT Infrastructure

Cyber Security

Training / Enablement

Use minimal icons or simple dividers

5. Footer

Iconic mark or wordmark

One-line brand statement

Muted text color

No clutter

Interaction & Motion

Hover effects only where meaningful

Subtle transitions (200–300ms)

No bounce, no elastic easing

Buttons and links should feel mechanical and precise

Technical Requirements

Build using semantic HTML

Clean, readable CSS (or Tailwind if preferred)

Mobile-first, fully responsive

No external UI libraries

No unnecessary JavaScript

Code must be production-ready and easy to extend

Overall Goal

The landing page should feel like:

A serious technology company’s digital front door — modern, confident, and trustworthy.

Do not over-design.
Do not add features not requested.
Clarity, restraint, and precision matter more than decoration.
